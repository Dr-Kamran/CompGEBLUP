Description: A complete toolkit for genomic selection including additive, 
    dominance, epistatic effects, GxE interactions, multi-trait selection, 
    cross-validation, and GWAS. Features an independent REML-based mixed model 
    engine with EMMA-style efficient algorithms, Henderson EM-REML with full 
    trace-corrected variance component updates, exact REML log-likelihood, and 
    fast C++ matrix operations using RcppArmadillo. Implements proper BLUP 
    equations for prediction of untrained individuals. Supports custom 
    user-defined relationship matrices (reaction norm, combined, RKHS kernels), 
    differential per-matrix ridge regularisation, and QTL-aware GBLUP for 
    separating major QTL effects from polygenic background.
