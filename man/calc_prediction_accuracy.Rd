\title{Calculate True Prediction Accuracy from Predictive Ability}
\usage{
calc_prediction_accuracy(predictive_ability, h2)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictive_ability}{Correlation between GEBV and observed phenotype}

\item{h2}{TRUE narrow-sense heritability (NOT estimated from training data)}
}
\value{
True prediction accuracy (correlation between predicted and true breeding values)
}
\description{
Converts predictive ability (correlation between GEBV and phenotype) to
true prediction accuracy by adjusting for heritability.
}
\details{
Predictive ability (r) is the correlation between predicted GEBVs and observed
phenotypes: r = cor(GEBV, y).

True prediction accuracy (rA) is the correlation between predicted and true
breeding values: rA = r / sqrt(h2)

\strong{IMPORTANT}: The h2 parameter must be the TRUE heritability, not an
estimate from the training data. Using estimated h2 (especially from small
training sets) will produce unreliable and potentially misleading accuracy
values. Use this function only when:
\itemize{
\item You know the true h2 from simulation parameters
\item You have a reliable h2 estimate from a large independent dataset
\item You want to make theoretical comparisons
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# CV returned predictive ability of 0.5
# TRUE heritability (from simulation) is 0.6
true_accuracy <- calc_prediction_accuracy(0.5, h2 = 0.6)
# true_accuracy = 0.5 / sqrt(0.6) = 0.645

# DO NOT use estimated h2 from training data - results will be unreliable
}
