\description{
Computes an approximation of Prediction Error Variance for each individual.
}
\details{
True PEV requires the full coefficient matrix inverse from the mixed model equations,
which is computationally expensive to store and compute for large datasets. This function
provides a practical approximation based on individual prediction quality:

PEV_i approximately equals sigma^2_g * (1 - r^2_i)

where r^2_i is the squared correlation between GEBV and observed phenotype for individual i
within their environment group. This approximation correctly identifies individuals with
higher/lower prediction reliability, though it may not match MME-based PEV exactly.

For small datasets (<1000 individuals), consider computing true PEV using the full
MME coefficient matrix inverse.
