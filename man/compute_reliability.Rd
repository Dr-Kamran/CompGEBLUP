\title{Compute Reliability of GEBVs}
\usage{
compute_reliability(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{GBLUPModel object}
}
\value{
Vector of reliability values (0 to 1)
}
\description{
Computes reliability (1 - PEV/σ²_g) for each individual's GEBV.
Reliability indicates the proportion of genetic variance captured by the prediction.
}
\details{
Reliability ranges from 0 (no information) to 1 (perfect information).
Values typically range from 0.3-0.8 depending on:
\itemize{
\item Training population size
\item Genetic relationship to training population
\item Heritability of the trait
\item Marker density
}

This function uses an approximation of PEV based on prediction quality within
environment groups. For true MME-based reliability, the full coefficient matrix
inverse would be needed, which is computationally expensive for large datasets.
