\title{Expected Prediction Accuracy (Theoretical)}
\usage{
expected_accuracy(n_train, h2, Me = NULL, n_markers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_train}{Training population size}

\item{h2}{Narrow-sense heritability}

\item{Me}{Effective number of independent chromosome segments. If NULL,
uses n_markers/50 as a rough approximation.}

\item{n_markers}{Number of markers (used to estimate Me if not provided)}
}
\value{
Expected prediction accuracy (theoretical upper bound)
}
\description{
Calculates the theoretically expected prediction accuracy based on
training population size, heritability, and effective number of markers.
Uses the formula from Daetwyler et al. (2008).
}
\details{
The formula is: r = sqrt(N * h2 / (N * h2 + Me))

Where:
\itemize{
\item N = training population size
\item h2 = narrow-sense heritability
\item Me = effective number of independent chromosome segments
}

Me can be approximated as: Me ≈ 2 * Ne * L where Ne is effective population
size and L is genome length in Morgans. For most crop species, Me ranges
from 100-1000. A common approximation is Me ≈ number of markers / 10 to
number of markers / 100, depending on LD.

\examples{
# With 200 training individuals, h2=0.5, and Me=500
expected_accuracy(n_train = 200, h2 = 0.5, Me = 500)
# Returns: 0.41

# With smaller Me (higher LD), accuracy is higher
expected_accuracy(n_train = 200, h2 = 0.5, Me = 100)
# Returns: 0.71

# Estimate Me from markers (Me ≈ n_markers/50)
expected_accuracy(n_train = 200, h2 = 0.5, n_markers = 10000)
# Returns: 0.41 (Me = 200)
